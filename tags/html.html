    The html tag defines an HTML document.
    It is the root structure of a document.
    Excepting for the DOCTYPE tag, all tags are children of the html.
    This tag had a standard CSS style: 'html { display: block; }' and 'html:focus: { outline: none; }'.
    In addition, the tag has an 'xmlns' attribute, which specifies the document's xml namespace; it is standard and will be added to the html tag, even if you don't include it.
